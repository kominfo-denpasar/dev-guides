## Code Style Guides
- PHP-FIG PSR
- TBD.

## Tips
- Modularize code. Instead of writing one giant block of code, try breaking it into smaller, more manageable chunks (modules). This makes your code reusable, boosting your productivity in the long run. Plus, it makes it easier to spot errors and bugs during testing.
- Use design patterns. Don’t just wing it. Stick to proven web design patterns, like MVC (model view controller), to build high-quality back-end applications.
- Adhere to coding standards. Make sure you’re following industry standards and style guidelines to keep your code maintainable and readable. This also makes it easier for you to collaborate with other team members
- Use version control. Version control tools like Git help you and your team keep track of changes to the codebase. This way, you can avoid confusion and maintain high-quality standards
- Document your code. Even if you know what your code does, other team members might not be familiar with certain concepts. Adding in-line comments to your code helps others follow along easily
- Test, test, test. If your back-end application crashes in production, it can be a disaster and ruin the user experience. Test your application in different scenarios to minimize the chance of this happening.
